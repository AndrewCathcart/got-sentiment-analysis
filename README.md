# got-sentiment-analysis

## Description
This project is built using [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). 

It uses [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) for managing dependencies.

It contains a dataset, `cleaned-got.csv`, which contains 595,703 unique tweets from 2019-04-27 00:00:00 to 2019-05-04 00:00:00

These tweets detail users reactions to the highly anticipated [Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 3 "The Long Night"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Night_(Game_of_Thrones)) that aired on 2019-04-28.

## Future work
Use SentiWordNet for Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis rather than relying on the rule-based TextBlob implementation
